# Hi! - Quick intro:
This repo contains projects realised on scrimba, ReactQuizV2 is most relevant (solo project), tenzies would be another one to mention (exercise).
- ReactQuizV1: Solo project with specified tasks to complete in order to deliver mvp.
- ReactQuizV2: Changes made between v2 and v1 were introduced only by my initiative. No task requirements were provided etc. 
- Other projects were made in exercise driven formula ("do this, if you did then we'll show you our approach", great to learn tbh but not to showcase actual abilities, right?)

# Tech:
JS, React, CSS.
